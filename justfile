# Deployment recipes for the SetFit MCP servers.

# The repo's quality gates live in the Makefile (tier1..tier4, coverage, contract
# audits) and stay there — this file is the deployment surface, which the
# Makefile never covered.

#   just --list                       # what is here
#   just build-trainer-asset          # the worker Lambda package
#   just synth-training dev           # validate the IaC, create nothing
#   just deploy-training dev          # create/update the AWS resources
#
# Arguments are POSITIONAL (`just synth-training dev`). `env=dev` is accepted
# too, because just passes it positionally rather than as an override and the
# resulting `--context env=env=dev` is a confusing way to learn that.

# Cross-compile the `apr` the worker spawns, for Lambda's arm64 runtime.

# `--no-default-features --features setfit` is load-bearing, not tidiness: the
# feature is dependency-closed, so this drops the GPU and inference stacks. With
# the defaults on, the build peaks past Docker's memory ceiling and dies with
# SIGKILL — that is what `cross` did before, and why this uses cargo-zigbuild
# (no Docker, host memory) instead.

# Assemble the worker's Lambda package: bootstrap + apr + dataset + encoder.

# The encoder ships as a SUBSET. The checkout carries both `model.safetensors`
# and `full_model.apr` at ~87 MB each, and the importer reads only the latter
# (`WEIGHT_FILE_CANDIDATES`), so copying the directory wholesale would put 87 MB
# of unread bytes into a package with a 250 MB ceiling.
