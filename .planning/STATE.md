# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-08-07)

**Core value:** A small labeled dataset can produce an accurate, fast, reproducible classifier that trains and runs entirely through Aprender's native Rust and APR lifecycle.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Differentiable MiniLM Conformance

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Differentiable MiniLM Conformance)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-08-08 -- Phase 1 planning complete

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

- Average duration: -
- Total execution time: 0.0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Use five hard capability gates in dependency order; later phases retain earlier invariants as regression contracts.
- [Phase 1]: Use `aprender-core::autograd::Tensor` as the only SetFit graph and prove the pinned MiniLM path before exposing training.
- [Phase 3]: SetFit identity requires encoder-update evidence followed by a separate unique-row multinomial head fit.
- [Phase 4]: Only a closed, production-reloaded, parity-verified F32 APR may reach evaluation, CLI prediction, benchmarking, or serving.
- [Phase 5]: Claims require all 40 shot/seed cells and identical sampled IDs for SetFit and 9B LoRA.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: Freeze numerical tolerances from pinned reference fixtures before examining Rust discrepancies; validate the real-weight mixed-batch graph before committing the full BERT refactor.
- [Phase 2]: Decide and version singleton-class and bounded-oversampling behavior during phase planning.
- [Phase 5]: Choose validation-only calibration and uncertainty estimators before collecting benchmark results.
- [Cross-cutting]: Preserve CPU-only package/MSRV/feature combinations and executable contract conventions from the repository's pre-release and APR dogfood skills.
